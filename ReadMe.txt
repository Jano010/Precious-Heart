Hello, kind stranger and welcome to my android app "Precious Heart"!, an app that helps to mantain a journal of your blood pressure. To star i'm going to apologize because to see my app runing you are going to need Android Studio. You can download it form here : https://developer.android.com/studio.
Well lets begin.

1) Once you have install Android Studio, and unzipp my file. Open Android Studio
2) The "Welcome to Android Studio" window will appear. Now select the "Open an existing Android Studio project"
3) Navigate to the folder where you unzip my files. And select the PreciousHeart2 folder, then press ok. Android Studio will began to build the files.
4) After a short time, just go to the upper right bar and you will see a green play button. Press it.
5) It will open a new window that will ask you to select a virtual devices. I will assume it's your first time here and you do not have any. At the bottom left of this window you will see "create New Virtual Device" button, press it.
6) A wizard to create your device will open. Here just select the option "Pixel" and click Next
7) Sorry again, you will have to download to system image for your Virtual Device. Click on the link in Download Nougat
8) Again a new window will appear. Just wait until the download is finished and click "Finish" on the bottom right.
9) After that select the system image that you donwloaded and click next
10) Finally just click Finish in the next window
11) Select your new Virtual Device and click Ok.
12) After a while to virtual device should start, just wait a moment and then the app will begin to run
13) Now that you are in the app you can enter values ??for the pressures and save it in a database with the save button. As you save the values ??you will see that in the bottom half of the screen will appear warnings or status of your blood pressure that depends on the values ??you introduce.
14) The "show history" button will take you to another window where you can see a table with all the registered values.
15) And, finally, the alarm button will take you to yet, another window to set an alarm. 

I hope it's not so troublesome to run the app. Thank you for taking your time (and hard disk space) to reviewing the app! Regards from Mexico!



Prototype - Scenarios

Scenario 1 – Astrid is analyzing her readings

Situation
Astrid, an accountant in an important business company, would like to know if she has hypertension or not. To do this she measure her blood pressure and save her results. She needs to see if most of the time her blood pressure is too high or too low. She wants to, with a quick view, tell if she has hypertension or not.

Outcome
Astrid is able to tell if she has hypertension or not based on what her readings has been. She can see all her readings and each time she saves a reading, she can know if her pressure is high or not.

Scenario 2 – Aaron is trying to figure if he already took his medicine or not

Situation
Aaron, a retired man of the suburbs, must take his blood pressure medicine all days in the morning without fail.  He is trying to make a habit of taking it right after he woke up, or after his breakfast, but is proving to be difficult. Sometimes he forgets to take it, or even worse, he forgot if he took it or not making possible to take a double dose and that could be dangerous. He wants to have some kind of reminder so he can remember to takes his medicine. Also sometimes he feels bad, like before he started to take the medicine. He wants to have some kind of log or journal where he can register each time he measure his blood pressure to see if it has been staying stable. 

Outcome
Aaron not only remembered to take his medicine thanks to the alarm that he programs in the morning, he also logs into his journal differents measures across differents days and, after a while, he sees that his medicine it is not working, her blood pressure stays high almost all the time. He has decide to go see a doctor.
